## Pre requisites

- Maven
- JDK8
- GlassFish 5

## Build the examples

Unzip GlassFish on the predefined directory depending on your OS:

* Windows: `c:\glassfish5`
* Unix: `$HOME/glassfish5`

You can also customize this path via the `glassfish.home.prefix` Maven property. Make sure to start with a clean domain.

Start GlassFish:
```
$GF_HOME/bin/asadmin start-domain
$GF_HOME/bin/asadmin start-database
```

Add a user to the `file` realm with the `TutorialUser`
```
$GF_asadmin create-file-user --groups TutorialUser admin
```

Clone this repository and build the examples using:

```
mvn install
```

*WARNING:* the module `connectors/trading-ear` has a known bug and won't deploy to GlassFish. Please comment it from `connectors/trading/pom.xml` if you want the build to succeed.
